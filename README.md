Hello World!

My name is Zane Anglin. I am currently a student at MSJC studying Computer Science. 
Previously, I was majoring in Environmental Science, but decided to change my major after some experience in the field.
I am particularly interested in forestry, and wildfire management, and hope to find myself one day using my technical skills to better the field.
Currently, I am learning Elixir and Pheonix, as well as arcGIS.
